    LYRICS:
    <p>
        From the day you arrived
        I've remained by your side
        In chains, entombed

        [Chorus]
        Placed inside
        Safe and sound
        Shapes and colors are all I see

        [Verse 2]
        On the day you arrived
        I became your device
        To name and soothe

        [Chorus]
        Placed inside
        Safe and sound
        Shapes and colors are all I see
        Shades of colors are all I feel

        [Instrumental Break]

        [Verse 3]
        From the day you arrived
        I have stayed by your side
    </p>
